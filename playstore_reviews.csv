Buyers are able to initiate charge backs and make false delivery claims at their own freewill while Mercari allows it. The notion of seller protection is a lie, and you won't be covered as a seller for 99% of shipping/carrier issues.

Now all of a sudden I'm getting charged the next label up. Which takes money from me and is actually giving my stuff away for free. Example: sold a pair of leggings $3 (weigh less than 1lb), shipping label for $4.99. When the order is complete, I get told they weighed over 1lb and getting charged the difference, $2.

So many that you spend half your time weeding them out. Ex. I wanted a $70 item, and it had $6.99 shipping.
